It includes a header, ordered, unordered and definition nested lists, a link to the source of the information followed by your name and the text <em>Assignment #1/Question 1.</em> No CSS please.

<h1>Question 2- Tables</h1>

Using HTML5, produce the table in figure 2 at the end of this handout of your 4 recent World Series champions and the requested information. Include the border attribute in your &lt;table&gt; tag to make it easier to identify the cells even though it will not pass the HTML5 validator. No other CSS please. (Question 4 will have you practicing with CSS.) Here are the specifications for the table:




<ol>

 <li>1<sup>st</sup> line: Include your name on the 1<sup>st</sup> line in a level 2 header.</li>

 <li>2<sup>nd</sup> line: level 4 header.</li>

 <li>Row #1 of table: level 1 header.</li>

 <li>Column #1 of table: contains image of the World Series Commissioner’s trophy.</li>

 <li>Row #3, columns 3 to 6: logos of the teams corresponding to the 4 champions you have picked.</li>

 <li>Column #2, rows 2 to 5: contain table headers.</li>

 <li>For the rest of the table, complete the remainder of the information for the teams you will have picked. (This info is available at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions">)</a></li>

 <li>Set the width of the first image to 200 pixels, and the width of each team logo to 100 pixels.</li>

</ol>




<h1>Question 3 – Forms</h1>

Create a single page that demonstrates an HTML form used for a hotel room reservation site for the hotels located in Montreal. Keep to the format in figure 3 at the end of the handout. You are free to change the text and choices. No CSS please. (Question 4 will have you practicing with CSS.)




Your page <u>must</u> include:

<ul>

 <li>A title within an <em>h</em> tag which shows the title of the form</li>

 <li>Two parts each within its own <em>fieldset</em> tag and each with its own <em>legend</em> tag: one to contain the Reservation information and one for the guests to enter the type of rooms and hotels they are looking for.</li>

 <li>In the <em>Reservation Information</em> part:

  <ul>

   <li>a <em>numerical</em> <em>input fields</em> to input the number of rooms the client wants to reserve. o <em>a radio buttons</em> to indicate if the guests smoke.</li>

   <li><em>Two inputs of type date </em>to indicate the check-in and check-out dates.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>In the <em>Room Specifications</em> part:

  <ul>

   <li>give the guest at least 5 possible combinations of single/double beds in a room, to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em></li>

   <li>give the guest at least 6 possible location choices to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em> o a<em> drop-down list</em> for the guest to select the price range they are looking for. Have at least 4 options with one being <em>No price limit</em>. o give the guest at least 5 possible values for the number of required parking (One of them should be selected by the guest)</li>

   <li>give the guest at least 6 possible <em>special facilities </em>options to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em>.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Include a <em>submit</em> button labelled <em>Search</em> and a <em>reset</em> button labelled <em>Start over</em>.</li>

</ul>




Note at this point the form will not do anything when submitted.  (No presentation attributes please.)




<h1>Question 4 – Presentation</h1>

Make a copy of your HTML page from question 3 and add the following presentation formatting. All formatting <strong>must</strong> be defined in the <em><u>head</u></em> section of your document.

<ol>

 <li>An image of your choice to the right or left of the top header (When the guest clicks on the image it should take them to the URL where the image is from). It might be easier to include this part in a table with 2 columns so that the image is next to the header.</li>

 <li>The background of your page should be any color other than white.</li>

 <li>Each <em>fieldset</em> border color should be different and not black or grey.</li>

 <li>The <em>legend</em> of each <em>fieldset</em> should be the same color as the border of the <em>fieldset</em> it belongs to.</li>

 <li>The background color of each <em>fieldset</em> should be different and other than white.</li>

 <li>The <em>labels</em> in each fieldset should be a lighter version of the border and legend color.</li>

 <li>All prompt input field labels should be bolded (such as <em>Smoker?</em>, <em>Start Date</em> …). Refer to figure 4 at the end of this handout.</li>
